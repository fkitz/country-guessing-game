# Country Guessing Game

As part of my [GIS Certificate](https://continuing.torontomu.ca/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&certificateId=170501), I completed a course in [programming](https://continuing.torontomu.ca/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=25083_). The aim of this assignment was to create a modular country guessing game. This game asks for the user to input their name and up to 10 hint-assisted guesses before revealing the true answer. It also records the user's name, guesses, and real answer in a .txt file.
